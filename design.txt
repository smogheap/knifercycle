KNIFERCYCLE
===========
An arcade-style game about riding and doing stunts on a bladed motorcycle.

Knifercycle is GPL3-licensed and built using HTML5 technology.  Firefox and
Chrome are primary targets, running on iPad or Android devices would be a
bonus.


Controls
========
On the ground:
           Up,Down:  Steer into other lanes
        Left,Right:  Change speed/direction
            Button:  Boost
In the air:
Up,Down,Left,Right:  Aim the knifercycle blade

Knifercycle supports any and all input methods.  Most input events translate
to keypresses for input-handling simplicity.  Any contradictory (left+right)
inputs cancel each other out.

Keyboard Mappings
-----------------
Keyboard controls are meant to be easily guessable, and map to the X-Arcade
family of joysticks on their default settings.
    Up:  Up, Num_8
  Down:  Down, Num_2
  Left:  Left, Num_4
 Right:  Right, Num_6
Button:  Ctrl, Alt, Space

Touch
-----
An on-screen 8-directional joystick and button will be shown if the "Start"
button is touched (as opposed to clicked or reacting to keypress).  An option
to show/hide/auto-display the overlay will be honored.
     ^
     _           _
<   (_)   >     (_)
     "          '-'
     v
   DRIVE       BOOST

Joystick
--------
Joystick axes and buttons will all be mapped the same as the touch joystick.
All axes and hats map to directional controls, and all buttons map to the
boost button.

Gyroscope / Accelerometer
-------------------------
Not supported, easy to hack in if someone really wants to somehow play by
wiggling.


Mechanics
=========

Acceleration, braking, and turning are all handled by the left and right
controls.  Holding the direction the knifercycle is facing will accelerate in
steps, though it is possible to accelerate more quickly by repeatedly tapping
forward.  Holding the opposite direction will brake until stopped, and again
repeatedly tapping back can brake even faster.

Holding or tapping the opposite direction while stopped will turn the
knifercycle around.

The boost function adds to the speed of the knifercycle for two seconds, over
a linear or sine-wave curve.  These curves may overlap (if boosts are saved
up and used rapidly) and further boost speed, up to a set cap.


Script
======

Prologue: Normal Mode
---------------------
Welcome to Crapnameville

The people grow restless.  They petition to change the town's name, but to
what?  The people need a symbol.  They need a hero.

You are Wingus K Dingus, local gravy enthusiast and amateur stunt man.  Your
latest stunt vehicle is ready.  You shall call it...

Knifercycle!

Your Knifercycle is in the shop.  Fortunately, your local fans have built you
this stunning replacement...

Mission 3: Abattoiretum
-----------------------
Due to budget cuts, the arboretum and abattoir have been merged.  Trim the
branches and cut the meat!  Remember: disinfect your knifercycle between jobs.

Mission 4: Kebab
----------------
A giant has agreed not to eat the townspeople if someone will make him a nice
kebab.  He wants one of each ingredient, plenty of barbecue sauce, well-done.

Epilogue
--------
Wingus K Dingus amazed the townspeople, and with the help of his knifercycle,
he also saved their lives.

The giant had a nice kebab, and the people now have their hero.

Welcome to Wingdingston
