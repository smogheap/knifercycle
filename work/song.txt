KNIF-ER-CYCLE!! KNIF-ER-CYCLE!!
...


Ending
------
The town is saved!
Kadingus braved
the levels and the hungry giant thing.
He gave his life
and used his knife-
-er-cycle to res-
-cue our town
from its strife.

The he-ro of Crapnameville did
crowd-pleasing stunts.
He filled up our hearts and he
crashed more than once.
mi mii mi mi mi mi mi mi
moo mo mo moo, mu
muu mu mu mu mu mu mu
naa na na naa

cycle of kni-i-i-i-ife
that cycle of kni-i-i-i-ife
his cycle of kni-i-i-i-ife
our cycle of knife
